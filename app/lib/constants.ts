      "Greek fathers have come up with principles of Philosophy and Logics which are windows or domain from which life is seen and examined in conformity with Natural Laws in order to live a graceful and prosperous life. These ethics are aimed at success and prosperity of an individual and for the protection of the wellbeing of the Universe which is the abode of humans. For life to have a meaning, one could not live a lawless life. There must be conformity to simple principles of Natural Laws.\nParents have been given the authority over their children with simple basic objectives. That is to ensure that generations after them must live successful lives. How is this done? They need to inculcate in their children lot of information as to how to live life successfully on earth. This is the prerogative of this book. You really need to read this book to be able to examine your life. The Greek Scholar Socrates made this simple proposition, “An unexamined life is not worth living.” You need to examine your life in line with these Natural Laws outlined in this book.",
